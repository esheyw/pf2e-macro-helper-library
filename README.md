# PF2E Macro & Helper Library
This module exists because I'm not good enough at TypeScript to contribute directly to Workbench. 
It is a collection of macros and helper functions I've written for PF2e. It will (hopefully) be continually expanding. If you have a macro you'd like to contribute, and it's unsuitable for inclusion in Symon's repo (ie, it uses some of the helper functions provided by this module), feel free to open a PR, or open an issue if you don't want to git.
